> /home/toracle/.local/bin/aider --file translations/ko/web-server/web-server.markdown --yes-always -m Continue translating the web-server chapter from line 56 onwards. Translate the section about HTTP request details, including:

1. The explanation about HTTP requests being just text
2. The HTTP method descriptions (GET/POST)
3. The HTTP headers section with the code example
4. The HTTP response format section  
5. The section about HTTP being stateless and cookies
6. The URL parameters section with examples

Follow the established Korean translation style:
- Use -습니다 endings for respectful tone
- Preserve all code examples unchanged
- Keep figure references unchanged  
- Use natural Korean sentence structure
- Apply consistent terminology from earlier sections
- Maintain technical accuracy
